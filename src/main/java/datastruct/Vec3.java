package datastruct;// KHK: status 30.4.2014
// KHK: I downloaded this file with the accompaning files 
// KHK: I used it at an intermediate devolopment state for my target to source transformation
//      it worked fine, but was very slow
//      I learned a lot from these files. Especially the math behind raytracing!! Many thanks to the author.
//      I also like the data structures he implemented: vec3, Triangle3d...
//      This implementation of Triangle3d was modified by me to add several methods to return values (like boundingBox ...)
